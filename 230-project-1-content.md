# Defend the Cheese
## High Concept
Mice attack the player's cheese in a [Google Zerg Rush](https://www.google.com/search?q=zerg+rush&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS761US761&oq=zerg+rush&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5.1359j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
fasion - if they eat enough of the cheese it's game over.
## Genre
This game would fall under the Shooter category, as the user has to aim at and "shoot" (click) the mice to exterminate them before they reach the cheese.
## Platform
This game is intended for desktop.
## Story
"In a post-apocalyptic world, your survival is reliant on the safety of your rations. Your supply is meager -
all that remains are some chunks of cheese. Unfortunately, a pack of mice nearby have picked up the scent of your food
and are almost as hungry as you are. As the hoard approaches, defending the cheese means defending your life. Grab your weapon and take them down."

Just like zergs, the mice come in waves. The goal is to take out as many mice as you can before they eat all of your cheese.
## Esthetics
Both the graphics and the sound will be simplistic, in an 8-bit style. The player's "shots" and the mice will have sound effects, accompanied by a short, looping background tune.
## Gameplay
This game is endless, and has a similar appeal to cookie clicker games due to its repetitiveness. There is also progression, as the waves become more difficult as time goes on. The player uses the mouse (ironically) to attack - otherwise, the game is self explanatory. The player must react quickly to attacking mice and be on the lookout for enemies in all directions. Failing to pay close attention will lose them the game.
